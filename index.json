Snake robots are ideal for traversing through constrained environments such as pipes, cluttered and rough terrain whereas bipedal robots are more suited for structured environments such as stairs. Finally, quadruped robots are more agile than bipeds and can carry larger payloads than snake robots but struggle to navigate through soft soil, sand, ice and constrained environments. A Re-configurable robot can achieve the best of all worlds. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art re-configurable robots rely on rearrangement of modules through complicated mechanisms to dissemble and assemble at different places which increases its size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements. We propose Re-configurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS) which is capable of transforming between mobility modes without any rearrangement of modules. Hence, requiring just a single modification mechanism. Furthermore, our design allows the robot to split into two agents to perform tasks in parallel for biped and snake mobility. Experimental results demonstrate these mobility capabilities in snake, quadruped and biped modes along with transition between them.\n","date":1582761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582761600,"objectID":"e7613b36a4c0fdb0b6d059a12a8b9346","permalink":"https://harshadzade.github.io/project/snake/","publishdate":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/snake/","section":"project","summary":"A re-configurable robot which can transition into biped, quadruped and snake configurations without any re-arrangement of modules.","tags":["Bio-inspired Robotics","Snake Robots","Reconfigurable Robotics"],"title":"Reconfigurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582761600,"objectID":"3f53f610cfdaf2629b9156de1b0bdb7b","permalink":"https://harshadzade.github.io/project/sahayak/","publishdate":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sahayak/","section":"project","summary":"A teleoperated differential-drive robot to deliver food packets and medicines to the COVID patients.

Following this method, a swarm of multiple robots can cooperatively achieve a goal with collective intelligence. However, only a few such robotic systems are developed, and again very few are deployed outside of lab environments. The reason behind this is the lack of easy-to-deploy communication stack and a versatile library of essential swarm building functions from a hardware perspective. As a result, most researchers choose the option of simulation only. Hence in this article, we present an open source library integrated with a communication stack and tools which simplifies the process of hardware-level implementation of swarm algorithms. As the library presents multiple functions which are identified as basic building blocks of various swarm algorithms, it helps the user in creating future algorithms. Also, this library is open for collaborations from community and has a potential to become single solution for all swarm related applications.\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"b593d972a38f969633bc2f01c93f3244","permalink":"https://harshadzade.github.io/project/swarm/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/swarm/","section":"project","summary":"Implemented a mesh network based on IEEE 802.15.4 to establish consensus in a swarm of robots.
